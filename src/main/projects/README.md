# Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio

During the cybersecurity course, we completed a series of hands-on projects to demonstrate the skills and knowledge gained throughout the program. The projects include:

- [System Hardening](SystemHardening/README.md) — Focused on securing systems by applying best practices to reduce vulnerabilities.
- [Penetration Testing](pentesting/README.md) — Involved assessing systems for weaknesses and simulating real-world attacks.
- [Defensive Security](DefensiveSecurity/README.md) — Implemented monitoring, detection, and response mechanisms to defend against threats.
- [Digital Forensics](DigitalForensics/README.md) — Covered the investigation and analysis of security incidents and digital evidence.

Each project highlights a critical area of cybersecurity and showcases applied technical skills.
