# Offensive Security CTF Project

## Overview
In this project, we applied offensive security skills to attack the fictional Rekall Corporation and identify vulnerabilities. This was structured as a Capture the Flag (CTF) exercise where flags were hidden within Rekall’s web applications and operating systems.

## Project Goals

**Day 1: Web Application Exploitation**
- Exploit vulnerabilities in Rekall’s web applications.
- Locate and capture hidden flags.

**Day 2: Linux Server Exploitation**
- Target vulnerabilities in Rekall’s Linux servers.
- Find and collect additional flags.

**Day 3: Windows Server Exploitation**
- Attack vulnerabilities in Rekall’s Windows servers.
- Capture remaining flags through system exploitation.

This project demonstrates practical penetration testing techniques across web, Linux, and Windows environments.
